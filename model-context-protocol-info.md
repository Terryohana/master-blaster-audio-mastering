# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Information

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework developed by AWS for Amazon Bedrock that standardizes how context is provided to large language models (LLMs). It helps developers build applications that can effectively manage context windows, which are critical for LLM performance.

## Key Features

1. **Standardized Context Management**: MCP provides a consistent way to handle context across different LLM providers and models.

2. **Context Window Optimization**: It helps optimize the use of context windows, which are limited in size (measured in tokens).

3. **Context Prioritization**: MCP allows developers to prioritize which information should be included in the context window when space is limited.

4. **Context Persistence**: It enables maintaining context across multiple interactions in a conversation.

## Context Window Sizes

Different models have different context window sizes. When you mention "context 7n," this likely refers to a context window size that is 7 times the base size (n). 

For example:
- If n = 4K tokens, then 7n would be 28K tokens
- If n = 8K tokens, then 7n would be 56K tokens

## Implementation

To implement MCP in your application:

1. **Define Context Categories**: Organize your context into categories like conversation history, user information, or reference documents.

2. **Assign Priorities**: Give each context category a priority level to determine what gets included when the context window is limited.

3. **Use the API**: When making calls to Amazon Bedrock, structure your requests according to the MCP specification.

4. **Handle Truncation**: Implement logic to handle cases where context needs to be truncated due to size limitations.

## Benefits

- **Improved Response Quality**: By providing relevant context, LLMs can generate more accurate and helpful responses.

- **Efficient Token Usage**: MCP helps optimize the use of tokens, which can reduce costs and improve performance.

- **Consistent Experience**: It provides a consistent way to manage context across different models and providers.

- **Scalability**: As models evolve with larger context windows, your application can easily adapt without major changes.

## Best Practices

1. **Prioritize Recent Information**: In conversations, recent messages are usually more relevant than older ones.

2. **Balance Context Types**: Include a mix of conversation history, user information, and relevant documents.

3. **Monitor Token Usage**: Keep track of how many tokens are being used for context to optimize costs.

4. **Test Different Approaches**: Experiment with different context structures to find what works best for your specific use case.

## Conclusion

The Model Context Protocol is a powerful tool for developers working with LLMs on Amazon Bedrock. By providing a standardized way to manage context, it helps build more effective and efficient AI applications.
