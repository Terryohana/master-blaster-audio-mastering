# Using Model Context Protocol with Amazon Q in Master Blaster

This guide explains how to use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation with Amazon Q in the Master Blaster Audio Mastering App.

## Overview

The MCP implementation helps provide structured context to Amazon Q, making its responses more relevant to your audio mastering tasks. By organizing context into categories and prioritizing information, we ensure Amazon Q has the most important information even with limited context windows.

## Key Benefits for Master Blaster

1. **Audio-Specific Assistance**: Amazon Q can provide advice tailored to your specific audio processing setup
2. **Context-Aware Recommendations**: Get EQ, compression, and mastering suggestions based on your current project
3. **Technical Documentation Access**: Amazon Q can reference Web Audio API documentation to help with implementation
4. **Conversation Continuity**: Maintain context across multiple questions about your audio project

## Implementation

The MCP implementation is in `amazon-q-mcp.js` and organizes context into four main categories:

1. **App State**: Current playback mode, audio file, project data
2. **Audio Processing**: EQ settings, compressor settings, audio analysis
3. **User Context**: User preferences, recent projects, saved presets
4. **Documentation**: Technical documentation about Web Audio API and audio processing

## Integration Example

```javascript
import MasterBlasterMCP from './amazon-q-mcp';

// In your main component
function AudioMasteringApp() {
  const [appState, setAppState] = useState({
    activeAudioMode: 'normal',
    isPlaying: false,
    // other state...
  });
  
  // Initialize MCP
  const mcpRef = useRef(new MasterBlasterMCP());
  
  // Update MCP context when app state changes
  useEffect(() => {
    mcpRef.current.updateAppState(appState);
  }, [appState]);
  
  // Example function to ask Amazon Q for help
  const askForHelp = async (question) => {
    try {
      // This would connect to Amazon Q in a real implementation
      const queryPayload = await mcpRef.current.queryAmazonQ(question);
      
      // Process response
      // const response = await amazonQClient.query(queryPayload);
      // mcpRef.current.handleResponse(response);
      
      return queryPayload;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error querying Amazon Q:", error);
    }
  };
  
  // Rest of your component...
}
```

## Example Queries

With this MCP implementation, you can ask Amazon Q questions like:

- "How can I reduce the muddiness in the low-mid range of my current track?"
- "What EQ settings would help bring out the vocals in this mix?"
- "Can you suggest compressor settings for this drum track?"
- "How do I implement a sidechain compression effect using the Web Audio API?"
- "What's causing the clipping in my audio output?"

## Context Window Optimization

The MCP implementation automatically prioritizes information based on:

1. Conversation history (highest priority)
2. Current app state
3. Audio processing settings
4. User preferences
5. Technical documentation (lowest priority)

When the context window is limited (e.g., 7n tokens), the most important information is included first.

## Next Steps

1. Connect the MCP implementation to the actual Amazon Q API
2. Add more specific audio analysis data to the context
3. Implement token counting for more accurate context management
4. Add specialized context for different audio processing tasks
