# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for deploying the Master Blaster web application using a GitHub repository. The application is a React-based frontend that uses Convex as its backend service. The deployment strategy needs to consider both the frontend deployment (to Netlify) and the backend deployment (to Convex), ensuring they work together seamlessly. The deployment process should be automated, secure, and maintainable, allowing for continuous deployment as changes are pushed to the repository.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the frontend web application to Netlify using my GitHub repository, so that the application is accessible online with minimal manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user connects their GitHub repository to Netlify THEN the system SHALL establish a connection between the two platforms.
2. WHEN the user configures build settings in Netlify THEN the system SHALL use these settings for deployment.
3. WHEN code is pushed to the specified branch in GitHub THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger a new deployment.
4. WHEN a deployment is triggered THEN the system SHALL build the application according to the specified build command.
5. WHEN a build completes successfully THEN the system SHALL deploy the application to a public URL.
6. WHEN a deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to help diagnose the issue.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure environment variables for the Netlify deployment, so that sensitive information is not exposed in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adds environment variables in Netlify THEN the system SHALL securely store these variables.
2. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL inject the environment variables into the build process.
3. WHEN environment variables are updated THEN the system SHALL use the updated values in subsequent deployments.
4. IF environment variables are required but not provided THEN the system SHALL fail the build with a clear error message.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure custom domain settings for the Netlify deployment, so that the application is accessible via a branded domain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adds a custom domain in Netlify THEN the system SHALL configure DNS settings for that domain.
2. WHEN a custom domain is configured THEN the system SHALL provision an SSL certificate for secure HTTPS access.
3. WHEN users access the application via the custom domain THEN the system SHALL serve the application securely.
4. IF DNS configuration is incorrect THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on how to fix the issues.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor the performance and status of my deployed application, so that I can ensure it remains available and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deployment is completed THEN the system SHALL provide deployment status and performance metrics.
2. WHEN the application experiences issues THEN the system SHALL provide notifications and diagnostic information.
3. WHEN the user accesses the Netlify dashboard THEN the system SHALL display analytics about site traffic and performance.
4. WHEN the user needs to roll back to a previous version THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to deploy a previous build.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure build hooks and deploy previews, so that I can test changes before they go live.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created in GitHub THEN the system SHALL generate a deploy preview.
2. WHEN a deploy preview is generated THEN the system SHALL provide a unique URL to access that preview.
3. WHEN the user configures build hooks THEN the system SHALL allow triggering deployments from external systems.
4. WHEN a build hook is triggered THEN the system SHALL initiate a new deployment with the specified settings.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy and configure the Convex backend to work with my Netlify frontend deployment, so that the complete application functions correctly in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user deploys the Convex backend THEN the system SHALL provide a production deployment URL.
2. WHEN the frontend is built for production THEN the system SHALL use the correct Convex deployment ID.
3. WHEN the application is accessed in production THEN the system SHALL connect to the correct Convex backend.
4. WHEN authentication is configured THEN the system SHALL ensure Clerk authentication works correctly with both Netlify and Convex.
5. WHEN environment variables are updated in either Netlify or Convex THEN the system SHALL maintain proper integration between frontend and backend.
6. IF the Convex backend requires updates THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to deploy these changes independently of the frontend.
