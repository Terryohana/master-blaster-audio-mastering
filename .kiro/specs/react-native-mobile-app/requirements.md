# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Master Blaster React Native Mobile App is a professional audio mastering application that brings the full functionality of the existing web-based Master Blaster to mobile platforms (iOS and Android). The app will provide users with professional-grade audio processing capabilities including EQ, compression, and other audio effects, while maintaining seamless integration with the existing Convex backend and Clerk authentication system. The mobile implementation will leverage native audio processing capabilities for optimal performance and user experience on mobile devices.

1. WHEN a user accesses the compressor module THEN the system SHALL display threshold, ratio, attack, and release controls
2. WHEN a user adjusts compressor parameters THEN the system SHALL apply compression in real-time
3. WHEN compression is active THEN the system SHALL display a gain reduction meter showing current compression amount
4. WHEN audio is playing THEN the system SHALL display input and output level meters
5. WHEN a user adjusts parameters THEN the system SHALL update the compression curve visualization
6. WHEN compressor is bypassed THEN the system SHALL process audio without compression
7. IF compression processing fails THEN the system SHALL display an error and continue with uncompressed audio

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to save and manage my audio projects, so that I can continue working on them later

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new project THEN the system SHALL save it to Convex backend with unique identifier
2. WHEN a user modifies project settings THEN the system SHALL auto-save changes every 30 seconds
3. WHEN a user manually saves THEN the system SHALL immediately sync all changes to backend
4. WHEN a user opens the projects list THEN the system SHALL display all their saved projects with thumbnails
5. WHEN a user searches projects THEN the system SHALL filter results based on project name
6. WHEN a user deletes a project THEN the system SHALL remove it from backend after confirmation
7. IF network is unavailable THEN the system SHALL save changes locally and sync when connection is restored

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to export my processed audio in various formats, so that I can use it in other applications

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates export THEN the system SHALL display format options (WAV, MP3, etc.)
2. WHEN a user selects export format and quality THEN the system SHALL render the processed audio offline
3. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL save the file to device storage or allow sharing
4. WHEN export is in progress THEN the system SHALL display progress indicator and allow cancellation
5. WHEN a user adds metadata THEN the system SHALL embed it in the exported file
6. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL display error message and allow retry
7. WHEN export succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide options to share or save to cloud storage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to interact with Amazon Q for audio processing guidance, so that I can get AI-powered assistance

#### Acceptance Criteria
