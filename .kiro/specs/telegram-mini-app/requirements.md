# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Master Blaster Telegram Mini App is a lightweight version of the Master Blaster audio mastering application designed to run within the Telegram messaging platform. This Mini App will provide essential audio processing capabilities including EQ and compression while maintaining integration with the existing backend services. The implementation will leverage Telegram's Mini Apps platform to deliver a seamless audio mastering experience directly within Telegram, with authentication handled through Telegram's built-in user identity system rather than Clerk.

The Mini App will include a subscription model to monetize premium features, leveraging Telegram's payment system for seamless in-app purchases. This will allow for different tiers of access to audio processing capabilities, with basic features available for free and advanced features unlocked through subscription.
